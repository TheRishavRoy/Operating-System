What Are systemd Targets?
- Targets are modern replacements for traditional runlevels in systemd.
- They define the state of the system (e.g., graphical mode, multi-user mode).
- Stored as unit files in /lib/systemd/system/ or /etc/systemd/system/


Target Name         	    Purpose
===================================================================================
default.target	          The default boot target (often graphical or multi-user).
graphical.target	        Boots into GUI (X11, Wayland, GNOME, KDE).
multi-user.target	        Boots into CLI-based multi-user system (no GUI).
rescue.target	            Minimal recovery mode (limited functionality).
emergency.target	        Barebones mode (only essential system utilities).

- systemd determines the boot mode based on the default target, which can be checked using systemctl get-default. 
- Common targets include multi-user.target (CLI-based boot) and graphical.target (GUI-based boot). 
- The system follows dependencies defined in target unit files stored under /lib/systemd/system/. 
- If needed, we can switch targets dynamically using systemctl set-default <target>.
